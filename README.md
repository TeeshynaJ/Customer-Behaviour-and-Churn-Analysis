##Customer Behaviour and Churn Analytics: Predictive Insights and Dashboard Reporting for Strategic Retention

This project focuses on understanding customer churn in the banking sector. Since acquiring new clients is significantly more costly than retaining existing ones, it is essential for banks to identify the factors that influence customersâ€™ decisions to leave. By uncovering these drivers, banks can design effective loyalty programs and retention strategies to minimize churn and improve customer lifetime value.
